Story: contact registration
  As a company employee
  I want to register contact in the CRM
  So that other employees can use the information to make the company more profitable
  
Scenario: a new client company
  Given the company name "My Client"
  And the company information: address "any street, 57" and home page http://www.myclient.com
  When the search form is submited
  Then no results should be returned
  When the client company registration form is submited
  Then the company page should appear
  
Scenario: contacts for the new client company
  Given the company name "My Client"
  When the search form is submited
  Then the company page should appear
  When the new contact link is followed
  Then the contact registration form should appear
  Given the contact name "José da silva"
  And the contact information: email jose@myclient.com, home page http://jose.myclient.com, address "Meu endereço, 57"
  When the contact creation button is clicked
  Then a new contact for that company should be created
  And the company page should appear
  And the new contact should be listed in the page
  
Scenario: selecting the main contact for a company
  Given the company name "My Client"
  When the search form is submited
  Then the company page should appear
  When the "main contact" link is clicked for a company contact
  Then the selected contact should be set as the company main contact
