Story: contact event managenment
  As a company employee
  I want to register all movement from a contact, like calls and e-mails
  So that other employees can use the information to make the company more profitable
  
Scenario: Receiving a call from a client
  Given the company name "My Client"
  And the contact name "José da silva"
  When the search form is submited
  Then the contact event history for the informed contact should be shown
  Given the event description "The client want more 50 products"
  When the register button is pressed
  Then the last log for this contact should apear in the contact history page
  And it should be the first record on the page
  
Scenario: Other contact on the same client call
  Given the company name "My Client"
  And the contact name "João Paulo"
  When the search form is submited
  Then the system should ask if I want to register a new contact for the same client
  Given the contact information: email joao@myclient.com, home page http://joao.myclient.com, address "Meu endereço, 95"
  When the confirmation button is pressed
  Then the contact history page for the new contact should appear
  And the last logs from other contacts in the same company should appear in the page
  Given the event description "The client asked about the price for the products"
  When the register button is pressed
  Then the last log for this contact should apear in the contact history page
  And it should be the first record on the page
  And the last logs from other contacts in the same company should appear in the page
